    "This is a proposed computing model based on the principles of the brain's architecture. This is similar in inspiration to multilayer perceptrons (aka. MLPs, neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar way to MLPs, the model can be defined as [1]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f : S \\rightarrow A$$\n",
    "$$g : A \\rightarrow P$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $$y = \\sum A^{\\*}_i w_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $A$ are association cells (TODO explain), $P$ are response output vectors, $S$ are the sensory input vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MLP vs CMAC\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between MLPs and CMAC [1] is that in MLPs $f$ is fully connected, while CMAC restricts the associations to neighbors. This is more in tune with Convolutional Nueral Networks in a sense (TODO cite).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences from the human brain\n",
    "\n",
    "There are suggestions that the cerebellum is capable of exclusive disjunction which is not in CMAC [1]. TODO more on this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of CMAC\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the restriction on mapping function effectively decreased the\n",
    "chance of been trapped in a local minimum during learning\n",
