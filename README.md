# CMACvTileCode

Here we introduce the CMAC algorithm. Compare it to the human brain, CNNs, HMAX, and MLPs. We then implement a Tensorflow version of CMAC (TileCoding) and compare it's function approximation capabilities to a simple MLP. In writing our implementations we found a number of helpful sources any code which has been used has been cited inline.

Please see CMAC.ipynb for a complete walkthrough of CMAC and our analysis.

to run the tilecoding experiments run:

$ python tile_coding_experiments.py

and to run the MLP experiments run:

$ mlp_experiments.py


Note: This was tested using TensorFlow v1.0.
